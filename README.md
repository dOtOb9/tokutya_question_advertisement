**Introduction:**
The other day, I encountered an advertisement for a special tea inside a train that resembled the one depicted below. In this instance, I aim to analyze it using Python's matplotlib. The approach, however, is quite straightforward; it involves connecting points to create the graph.

**Methodology:**
Consider, for instance, the function \( y = -6x + 16 \) \((-4 \leq x \leq 3)\). As this function is linear, it can be represented by a straight line. Furthermore, by connecting the endpoints, we can plot it on a graph. All the functions mentioned in the problem can be plotted as straight lines by connecting their respective endpoints. Therefore, by determining and connecting the endpoints, we can plot the graph.
