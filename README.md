## Introduction
The other day, I came across an advertisement for special tea inside a train that looked like the one below. This time, I will attempt to analyze it using Python's matplotlib. However, the approach is quite straightforward; it involves connecting points to create the graph.

## Methodology
Let's take, for example, the function y = -6x + 16 (-4 <= x <= 3). Since this function is a linear function, it can be represented by a straight line. Moreover, by connecting the endpoints, we can plot it on a graph. The functions mentioned in the problem are all such that they can be plotted with straight lines by connecting their respective endpoints. Therefore, by determining and connecting the endpoints, we can plot the graph.
